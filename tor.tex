In a nutshell, onion routing refers to encapsulating message under layers of encryption at different nodes before it reaches the final destination. 
All the nodes only know about the previous node and the next node. 
In this way, no single node knows the entire path of the message. 
Clients choose these path randomly and build a circuit. 
These circuits change every few minutes preventing any snooping attempts.

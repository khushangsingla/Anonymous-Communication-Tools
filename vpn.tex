\section{VPN}
VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. VPNs provide a set of servers through which the connected clients
route their traffic. The cost to maintain VPN services is high as with increase in number of clients, the
service provider needs to get more servers to keep up with the load. This reduces scalability of VPNs. 

One bigger problem of VPN is that the admin of the VPN servers can see what each user is accessing, thus 
VPNs can't be considered enough anonymous.
VPNs are mostly used to be able to access a private network from anywhere and less popular to be used
for privacy or anonymity over internet. But they may well be used to hide from the websites, who is trying to
access the content as for the websites see the VPN servers as their clients.
